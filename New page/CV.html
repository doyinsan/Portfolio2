  <h1> CV: Dele Oyinsan </h1>
  <div>
 <p>I am a Bsc Computer Science Graduate from London Metropolitan University,
  looking to secure a graduate role in Android/Web developer positions or a similar position to enhance
my skills.
C Languages, Java, HTML, CSS and SQL have been the core of my focus over the period of
learning. Obtaining these skills has allowed me to further advance my understanding and
analytic skills. From my experience in Retail jobs (Sport direct) and with freelanceâ€™s
companies (So sick Clothing), it has given me the understanding and patience of customers
demands.</p>
